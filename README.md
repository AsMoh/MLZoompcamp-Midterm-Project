# MLZoompcamp-Midterm-Project
This repository contains my midterm project for ML zoom camp 2022. 
Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15 

The Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) has created the raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool. The purpose of this dataset is to generate a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours.

My goal is to develop ML model that predicts whether a certain raw network packets is a cybersecurity attack or not.

The UNSW-NB15_features.csv file that is uploaded in this repo includes the features description.

The total number of records is two million and 540,044 which are stored in the four CSV files, namely, UNSW-NB151.csv, UNSW-NB152.csv, UNSW-NB153.csv and UNSW-NB154.csv.

In my project, I have used the data available in UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv file ( uploaded in this repository). 

Let's predict the probability that a raw network packet can be cybersecurity attack.
